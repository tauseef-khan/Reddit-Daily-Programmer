Reddit-Daily-Programmer
=======================

A showcase of all the challenges I have done on the subreddit 'Daily Programmer'.

Each week the subreddit 'Daily Programmer' posts three programming challenges of varying difficulty, Easy, Intermediate, Hard on Monday, Wednesday and Friday respectively.

I'll start of at the Easy difficulty just to get warmed up and into the swing of programming. Once, I feel comfortable to move on to the next level of difficulty, I'll do exactly that! If I have time or finish a challenge quicker than expected then I'll try to do some more challenges.

I will update the README file each time I add a file of the completed challenge to the repo, giving the details of the challenge, and maybe some comments of my own about how I completed the challenge or how difficult I felt it was.

What I hope to gain out of this is:

    - Improve my programming and problem-solving skills
    - A showcase to employers of my programming ability and enthusiasm for programming
    - Get the buzz of completing the challenges!
  
Here is the link to the subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

That's all for now!!!

P.S - The subreddit uses the date format (mm/dd/yyyy) for the challenge dates, whereas I use the format (dd/mm/yyyy) for dates written in this README file and in general thoughout this repo...SO BEWARE!

[04/08/2014] Challenge #174 [Easy] Thue-Morse Sequences

Date Attempted - 05/08/2014

Reading the description did confuse me, but after looking at the graphic on the Wikipedia article I understood what to do. I didn't find the challenge that difficult. 

I have a for loop within a for loop in the main method (the inner loop is in the 'append' method). I would like to make it more efficient as it currently has the big-O notation O(n^2). It doesn't really matter for the output required but for larger orders it will take pretty long I would imagine. I'll try to resolve this issue in the 'Extra Challenge'.

This challenge was interesting as throughout my university studies we have looked at mostly efficient ways of sorting. So to have a go at coding an inefficient sort helps me put into perspective how efficient sorting is very beneficial.

I didn't know how to create a method which jumbles up an array. So I got the code for the 'shuffle' method of a website. I understood what the code was doing and from now on I shall implement my own shuffle methods if needed.

This challenge was fun as I have used spread sheets before and to now code a feature of it (cell selection) has made me more appreciative of the work that has to go into it. It specified to use a bijective Base-26 system which I didn’t really understand so I decided to make a 10 by 10 grid instead as it was easier for me to work with. Other than that I didn’t make any other changes.


I decided I would convert the column names which were letters of the alphabet into numbers to make it easier to work with co-ordinates. But I didn’t know how to do this so I used code from a post I saw on StackOverflow.

This challenge went well as I was familiar with quicksort and recursion with lisp lists. So I used a similar structure to the programs I wrote for lisp lists with recursion. I just tailored it to this challenge and it worked out for me. Overall, a good refresher to quicksort.
