Reddit-Daily-Programmer
=======================

A showcase of all the challenges I have done on the subreddit 'Daily Programmer'.

Each week the subreddit 'Daily Programmer' posts three programming challenges of varying difficulty, Easy, Intermediate, Hard on Monday, Wednesday and Friday respectively.

I'll start of at the Easy difficulty just to get warmed up and into the swing of programming. Once, I feel comfortable to move on to the next level of difficulty, I'll do exactly that! If I have time or finish a challenge quicker than expected then I'll try to do some more challenges.

I will update the README file each time I add a file of the completed challenge to the repo, giving the details of the challenge, and maybe some comments of my own about how I completed the challenge or how difficult I felt it was.

What I hope to gain out of this is:

    - Improve my programming and problem-solving skills
    - A showcase to employers of my programming ability and enthusiasm for programming
    - Get the buzz of completing the challenges!

That's all for now!!!
